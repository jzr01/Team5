# NBA Player Performance Prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning models to predict NBA player performance using player statistics from the 2023 season. By analyzing key metrics such as points, rebounds, assists, and playing time, the project aims to provide insights into player performance. The data used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and includes over 500 player records.

## Features
